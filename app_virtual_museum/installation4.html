  <h1>Systemic Critique</h1>
  <p class="description">This section highlights artists who expose and subvert the invisible systems that shape our political and economic realities. Through interventions into currency, language, media, and consumer goods, these works disrupt the ideological circuits of colonialism, capitalism, and state control.</p>

  <p>Cildo Meireles (b. 1948, Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian conceptual artist widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary figures in Latin American art. He known for immersive installations and sculptures that provoke critical reflection on political and philosophical issues. His work emerged in response to Brazil’s military dictatorship during the 1960s and 1970s, and was shaped by Neo-Concretist and avant-garde influences. Meireles blends physical space, intellectual inquiry, and sensory experience, often inviting viewers to participate directly. Though rooted in specific historical contexts, his installations speak to broader, universal concerns through spatial engagement and shared perception.

  <!-- First Work -->
  <h3><i>Desvio para o Vermelho (Red Shift): Impregnation Room; Spill/Environment Room; Shift Room; Entrance Hall; Deposit,</i> (1967–1984)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Mixed media installation, approx. 300 × 1000 × 500 in (762 × 2540 × 1270 cm).</p>
  <p>In Red Shift (1967–1984), Cildo Meireles transforms three rooms into a progressively surreal, immersive installation centered on the color red. The first space, Impregnation, resembles an ordinary living room, except that every object is red, sourced via classified ads. In the second room, Spill, a small bottle appears to have unleashed an exaggerated flood of red liquid across the floor. The final space, Shift, features a tap running red water. Together, the rooms confront the viewer with the quiet tension of excess, consumption, and political violence through the saturation of a single color.

  <!-- Second Work -->
  <h3><i>Inserções em circuitos ideológicos 2: Projeto Cédula (Insertions into Ideological Circuits 2: Banknote Project),</i> (1970)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Ink on banknote</p>
  <p>Between 1970 and 1975, during Brazil’s military dictatorship, Cildo Meireles launched Insertions into Ideological Circuits, a covert, two-part conceptual project. He stamped politically charged messages like “Direct Elections,” “Yankees Go Home,” and “Who killed Herzog?” onto everyday objects such as Brazilian currency and Coca-Cola bottles, which he then returned to public circulation. These anonymous interventions transformed ordinary goods into vehicles of resistance, challenging censorship and authoritarian control through quiet yet widespread disruption.</p>
