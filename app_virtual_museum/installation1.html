  <h3><i>Looting</i> (2017)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Eight gold fillings, 53 9/16 × 14 15/16 × 14 15/16 in (136 × 38 × 38 cm)</p>
  <p>In <i>Looting</i>, Galindo transforms her own body into a site of political excavation. She had eight gold fillings made from Guatemalan gold implanted in her teeth, which were later extracted in Germany. The remaining gold imprints, displayed like ancient relics, critique the violent legacies of mining, colonization, and the museum’s role in extracting artifacts from the Global South. Her mouth becomes a metaphor for land, occupied, plundered, and made into spectacle.</p>

  <h2>Carlos Leppe</h2>

  <p>Carlos Leppe (1952–2015) was a pioneering Chilean visual and performance artist whose work challenged artistic and institutional norms through radical use of his body. A graduate of the Universidad de Chile, Leppe’s practice embraced avant-garde strategies, including body art and spatial intervention. Influenced by Joseph Beuys and others, he often used performance to explore themes of gender ambiguity, identity, and self-representation. His deeply personal pieces sometimes incorporated his mother as a participant, blurring the lines between public and private, art and autobiography.</p>

  <h3><i>Happening de las Gallinas</i> (1974)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Photographic documentation of performance. Black-and-white print, 13.5 × 20 cm. Edition 3/5 + 2 AP.</p>
  <p>In Happening de las Gallinas (1974), Carlos Leppe transformed the Carmen Waugh Gallery into a surreal performance environment that blurred the lines between ritual, parody, and protest. Surrounded by plaster hens, family photos, and symbolic props, Leppe enacted a performative egg-laying while dressed in a funeral wreath and seated on a modified chair. The work parodied motherhood and institutional violence, as spectators drank wine, broke hens, and eventually looted the space. By the end of the performance, over 70 hens were gone, dissolving the boundary between art and audience in a carnivalesque act of subversion.

  <h3><i>Acción de la Estrella (Star Action)</i> (1979)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong>  Standard-definition video (color, sound), 20 min</p>
  <p>In Acción de la Estrella (1979), Carlos Leppe shaves a five-pointed star into his scalp and aligns it with the Chilean flag, staging his own body as a site of national and cultural inscription. Referencing Duchamp’s 1919 gesture, Leppe critiques the symbolic occupation of bodies by state identity and colonial logic. Through ritual gestures involving paint, gauze, text, and a projected flag, he transforms his body into a contested national terrain, both singular and collective, both symbolic and wounded.</p>
