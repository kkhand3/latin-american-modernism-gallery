    <p>Belkis Ayón Manso (1967–1999) was a groundbreaking Cuban printmaker known for her powerful use of collography. Her work drew heavily from Afro-Cuban religious mythology, particularly the legend of Sikan and the rituals of the all-male Abakuá secret society. Ayón reimagined these stories through haunting, symbolic imagery like ghostlike figures, snakes, goats, and the iconic empty almond-shaped eyes that seem to pierce the viewer. Though her life ended in tragedy, Ayón’s contributions to printmaking and her reworking of gendered spiritual narratives have had a lasting impact on contemporary Cuban art.
