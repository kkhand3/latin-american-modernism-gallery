  <h1>Movement and Displacement</h1>
  <p class="description">This section explores how artists confront the legacies of forced migration, exile, and diasporic identity across the Afro-Atlantic world. Through walking, mapping, and memorializing, these works trace the scars of colonial movement and the resilience that follows.</p>

  <h2>Paulo Nazareth</h2>

  <p>Paulo Nazareth (b. 1977) is a Brazilian conceptual artist whose practice unfolds through movement. Treating travel itself as both medium and method, he walks or takes public transportation across Latin America and Africa, tracing migration routes and collecting images, objects, and encounters along the way. His performances, photographs, and installations function as living travel diaries that confront colonial histories, racial identity, and systems of global inequality. Nazareth blurs the line between life and art, insisting that every act, even leaving the art world, becomes part of his artistic process.</p>

  <h3><i>Southeast Africa</i> (2017)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Charcoal on newsprint, 48.5 × 67 cm (each); overall dimensions: 375.5 × 282 cm (147 13/16 × 111 in.)
</p>
  <p>In Southeast Africa (2017), Paulo Nazareth presents a solemn, minimalist memorial: the names of 25 Southeast African ethnic groups affected by genocide are inscribed in charcoal across newsprint panels. Part of his series Produtos do Genocídio (Products of Genocide), the work confronts the colonial and postcolonial erasure of African identities. Though visually restrained, the piece holds deep emotional and political weight, serving as both a record of violence and a quiet act of remembrance.</p>

  <h3><i>Sem título (Untitled)</i> (2011)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Two photographs printed on cotton paper, 23 5/8 × 31 1/2 in.
</p>
  <p>Sem título [Untitled] (2011) is part of Paulo Nazareth’s extended performance Notícias de América, a three-year journey from Brazil to the U.S. On foot and without washing his feet, Nazareth let the land accumulate on his body as he crossed borders. The performance culminated in New York, where he dipped his feet in the Hudson River, a symbolic act connecting the Americas. The accompanying photograph, stamped with the phrase “my image of exotic man for sale,” critiques the racialized commodification of identity under global capitalism. With understated power, Nazareth challenges how migration, colonial history, and the “exotic” are packaged and consumed.</p>

  <h2>Arjan Martins</h2>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/7e5b640d-4d88-435f-95e7-098461131f99/Screen%20Shot%202025-05-15%20at%207.23.20%20AM.png?v=1747313296503" alt="Arjan Martins">
  <p>Arjan Martins (b. 1960, Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian painter whose work centers on the African diaspora and the legacy of Afro-Atlantic migration. Trained at the School of Visual Arts at Parque Lage in the 1990s, Martins developed a rich visual language of maps, globes, sextants, and slave ships that trace the routes and weight of forced displacement. His paintings blend cartographic motifs with portraits of Afro-Brazilian life, linking past and present, history and daily experience. Through these works, Martins recovers erased geographies and reclaims Black presence in Brazilian and global narratives.</p>

  <h3><i>Atlântico,</i> (2016)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> 200 × 390 × 4 cm (78 3/4 × 153 1/2 × 1 5/8 in).
</p>
  <p>In Atlântico (2016), Arjan Martins renders the Atlantic Ocean as both a map and a graveyard, a space marked by cartographic symbols like caravels, crowns, and wind roses, and by the invisible weight of Black death. His compositions often include silhouetted, horizontal Black bodies, evoking the mass loss of life during the Middle Passage. Referencing historical estimates that over 14 enslaved Africans died each day en route to Brazil for over 300 years, Martins turns mapping into mourning, transforming colonial tools into a visual elegy for Afro-Atlantic history.</p>

  <h3><i>Sem título (Untitled),</i> (2019)</h3>
  <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Acrylic on canvas, polyptych, 300 × 600 × 4 cm (118 1/8 × 236 1/4 × 1 5/8 in); each panel 150 × 200 × 4 cm (59 1/8 × 78 3/4 × 1 5/8 in).
</p>
  <p>Created for the 2019 Montevideo Biennial in Uruguay, Sem título [Untitled] explores the displacement of Black bodies within sites of historical and political tension. Arjan Martins positions three figures in the foreground, visually linking them across the canvas with overlapping gestures and shared space. The work engages the legacy of Afro-Atlantic colonization, suggesting that beyond geographic distance, bodies remain connected through enduring histories of struggle and resistance.</p>
