        This installation presents artists and artwork that represents the transnationalism and decolonialism movement in Latin America. It aims to explores the impacts of displacement, the even present colonial legacies, and cultural hybridity that shape Latin American and Afro-Atlantic identities even today. From performance to cartographic painting, the selected works reflect resistance, migration, and its complexities.

        This installation is divided into four sections: "Embodied and Archival Resistance", "Myth, Memory, and Mourning", "Movement and Displacement", "Systemic Critique", each aimed at highlighting different aspects of this topic, and different artists and artworks in each area.
