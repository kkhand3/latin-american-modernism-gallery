This virtual gallery reimagines how modern and contemporary Latin American art can be experienced in digital spaces.
It highlights artists who challenged colonial narratives, blurred national borders, and expanded the definition of modernism through experimental, political, and embodied art practices.

The gallery’s structure mirrors a museum walkthrough, moving from a Main Exhibition to a specialized Transnationalism & Decolonialism Installation, inviting viewers to explore art as a dialogue across cultures and geographies.

Theme: Transnationalism and Decolonialism in Latin American Modernism

Focus Artists: Alfredo Jaar, Diamela Eltit, Carlos Leppe, Francisca Núñez, Jac Leirner, Cildo Meireles

Goal: To use web design as a curatorial tool, visualizing how digital interfaces can reflect layered histories, migration, and resistance.

This virtual gallery was originally built and hosted on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com), where the core HTML/CSS structure and interactive elements were developed.
